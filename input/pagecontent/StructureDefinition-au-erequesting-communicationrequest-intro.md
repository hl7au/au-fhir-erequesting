  - Communication requests about communication with a patient from a filler **SHALL** use the [AU eRequesting CommunicationRequest Patient](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-communicationrequest-patient.html) profile
  - Communication requests about communication from a filler to a clinical provider to notify them of urgent results **SHALL** use the [AU eRequesting CommunicationRequest Urgent Provider](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-communicationrequest-urgentprovider.html) profile
