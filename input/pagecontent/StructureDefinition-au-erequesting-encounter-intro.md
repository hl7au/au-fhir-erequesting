Obligations for AU Core actors ([AU Core Requester](https://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/2.0.0/ActorDefinition-au-core-actor-requester.html) and [AU Core Responder](https://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/2.0.0/ActorDefinition-au-core-actor-responder.html)) inherited from [AU Core Encounter](https://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/2.0.0/StructureDefinition-au-core-encounter.html) currently render in the profile view. This is a tooling limitation, and only the AU eRequesting actor obligations should be applied. See [Zulip discussion](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/215610-shorthand/topic/Sushi.20merging.20profile.20extension.20with.20parent.20content/with/545567478) for more information.
