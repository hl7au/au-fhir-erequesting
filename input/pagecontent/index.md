### Introduction
AU eRequesting is provided to support the use of HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> for clinical requesting and ordering in an Australian context. It sets the minimum expectations on FHIR resources to support conformance and implementation in systems.

AU eRequesting sets the minimum expectations for a system to record, update, search and retrieve information associated with a clinical service request. 

### Project background

This implementation guide is under development through the AU eRequesting project as part of the [Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HA/Sparked+FHIR+Accelerator). The Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator is a community comprising government, technology vendors, provider organisations, peak bodies, practitioners, and domain experts, to accelerate the creation and use of national FHIR standards in health care information exchange.

The AU eRequesting project includes:
- AU eRequesting Data for Interoperability
- AU eRequesting FHIR Implementation Guide

### How to read this guide

This guide is divided into several pages which are listed at the top of each page in the menu bar.

- [Home](index.html): This page provides the introduction and scope for this guide.
- [Conformance](conformance.html): This is a placeholder for when content becomes available.
- [Guidance](guidance.html): This is a placeholder for when content becomes available.
  - [AU eRequesting data for interoperability](auereqdi.html): This is a placeholder for when content becomes available.
  - [Relationship with other HL7 AU FHIR IGs](relationship.html): This is a placeholder for when content becomes available.
  - [AU Variance Statement](variance.html): This page documents variance from AU Base and AU Core.
  - [Future of AU eRequesting](erequesting-future.html): This is a placeholder for when content becomes available.
- [Use Cases](use-cases.html): This page describes the use cases in scope of eRequesting R1. 
- [FHIR Artefacts](artifacts.html): These pages provide detailed descriptions and formal definitions for all the FHIR artefacts defined in this guide.
  - [Profiles and Extensions](profiles-and-extensions.html): This set of pages describes the profiles and extensions that are defined in this guide to exchange quality data. Each profile page includes a narrative description and guidance, formal definition and a "Quick Start" guide which summarises the supported search transactions for each profile. Although the guidance typically focuses on the profiled elements, it may also may focus on un-profiled elements to aid with implementation.
  - [Terminology](terminology.html): This set of pages lists the value sets and code systems defined in this guide.
- [Examples](examples.html): This is a placeholder for when content becomes available.
- [Downloads](downloads.html): This is a placeholder for when content becomes available.
