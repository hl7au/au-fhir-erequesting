### Introduction
AU eRequesting is provided to support the use of HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> for clinical requesting and ordering in an Australian context. It sets the minimum expectations on FHIR resources to support conformance and implementation in systems.

AU eRequesting sets the minimum expectations for a system to record, update, search and retrieve information associated with a clinical service request. 

### Project background

This implementation guide is under development through the AU eRequesting project as part of the [Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HA/Sparked+FHIR+Accelerator). The Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator is a community comprising government, technology vendors, provider organisations, peak bodies, practitioners, and domain experts, to accelerate the creation and use of national FHIR standards in health care information exchange.

The AU eRequesting project includes:
- AU eRequesting Data for Interoperability
- AU eRequesting FHIR Implementation Guide

### AU eRequesting Actors

The following actors are part of AU eRequesting:

**AU eRequesting Placer**

A system that is responsible for initiating and creating diagnostic service requests. This system connects to enable requesters to provide the necessary information to create a request, ensuring that required data is accurately collected and provided to service providers with sufficient information for them to fulfil the request.  


**AU eRequesting Filler**

A system that is responsible for finding and retrieving diagnostic service requests so that service providers can fulfil them. It ensures that service providers have the necessary information to fulfil the requests and manages the requests through the fulfilment process.


**AU eRequesting Patient Access**

A system that is the digital interface that allows patients or their representatives to view and manage requests for diagnostic services. It provides access to request information, enabling patients to choose service providers and track the status of requests.

**AU eRequesting Server**

A system that accepts diagnostic service requests and makes diagnostic service requests accessible.


### How to read this guide

This guide is divided into several pages which are listed at the top of each page in the menu bar.

- [Home](index.html): This page provides the introduction and scope for this guide.
- [Conformance](conformance.html): This page describes the set of rules to claim conformance to this guide
- [Guidance](guidance.html): These pages list the guidance for this guide. 
  - [AU eRequesting Data for Interoperability](auereqdi.html): This page maps AUeReqDI data groups and elements to FHIR artefacts in AU eRequesting.
  - [Relationship with other IGs](relationship.html): This page provides guidance on the relationship between AU eRequesting, AUeReqDI, and other implementation guides.
  - [AU Variance Statement](variance.html): This page documents variance from AU Base and AU Core.
  - [Future of AU eRequesting](future.html): This page outlines the approach to developing AU eRequesting and yearly update cycle.
- [Use Cases](use-cases.html): This page describes the use cases in scope of eRequesting R1. 
- [FHIR Artefacts](artifacts.html): These pages provide detailed descriptions and formal definitions for all the FHIR artefacts defined in this guide.
  - [Profiles and Extensions](profiles-and-extensions.html): This page describes the profiles and extensions that are defined in this guide to support electronic requesting. Each profile page includes a narrative description and guidance, formal definition and a "Notes" section which summarises the supported search transactions for each profile. Although the guidance typically focuses on the profiled elements, it may also may focus on un-profiled elements to aid with implementation.
  - [Terminology](terminology.html): This page lists the value sets and code systems supported in this guide.
  - [Actor Definitions](actors.html): This page defines the AU aRequesting actors, AU eRequesting Placer, AU eRequesting Filler and AU eRequesting Patient Access.
- [Examples](examples.html): This page lists all the examples used in this guide.
- [Support](support.html): These pages provide supporting material for implementation of AU eRequesting.
  - [Downloads](downloads.html): This page provides links to downloadable artefacts.
  - [License and Legal](license.html): This page outlines the license and legal requirements for material in AU eRequesting.
