### Profile specific implementation guidance
- This abstract profile provides a shared base that is common across requests for specific domains. It is not intended for direct implementation. Where a profile is defined for a specific domain that profile **SHALL** be used:
  - pathology requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Pathology Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-path.html) profile
  - imaging requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Imaging Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-imag.html) profile 
- The provision of an insurance attribute describes a recommendation to be considered by the Filler and does not guarantee that this recommendation will be satisfied.
- The `supportingInfo` element is sliced to represent the following additional supporting information or clinical context  accompanying the request:
  - Shared clinical or administrative information **SHOULD** be represented using FHIR resources and referenced in the `supportingInfo` element of each ServiceRequest to which it applies. These resources may be referenced by all ServiceRequests in a group, when the information applies to the entire order, or by individual entries, when the information is specific to a single request.
  - The patient's **Pregnancy Status** represented by the `supportingInfo:pregnancyStatus` slice as a `Reference` to an [`Observation Pregnancy - Status (IPS)`](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/StructureDefinition-Observation-pregnancy-status-uv-ips.html).
    - Only the pregnancy status concept of "pregnant" is currently permitted, enforced via invariant `au-ereq-srr-02`, which requires the SNOMED CT code `77386006` (Pregnant).
  - **Clinical Context** narrative information providing an overview of the patient's current clinical situation represented by the `supportingInfo:clinicalContext` slice as a `Reference` to an [`AU eRequesting Clinical Context DocumentReference`](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-clinicalcontext-documentreference.html).
    - The Clinical Context DocumentReference **SHALL** be implemented as a plain text string (`text/plain`) embedded inline using `DocumentReference.content.attachment.data` (base64-encoded).
    - Although `ServiceRequest.note` can be used for clinical notes, it is limited to notes bound to a single ServiceRequest. In contrast, `supportingInfo:clinicalContext` allows the same clinical context to be referenced across multiple related ServiceRequests within an order.
      - To support clear presentation by Fillers and avoid duplication, shared clinical notes common across multiple ServiceRequests in a group **SHOULD** be captured using a single referenced `AU eRequesting Clinical Context DocumentReference`, rather than repeated in `ServiceRequest.note`.
      - There SHALL not be overlap between the content of `ServiceRequest.note` and `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo`.
