### Profile Specific Implementation Guidance
- This abstract profile provides a shared base that is common across requests for specific domains. It is not intended for direct implementation. Where a profile is defined for a specific domain that profile **SHALL** be used:
  - Pathology requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Pathology Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-path.html) profile
  - Imaging requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Imaging Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-imag.html) profile 
- This profile supports the sex and gender related concept of Sex Parameter for Clinical Use:
   - When exchanging concepts of sex or gender, refer to the guidance in [Sex and Gender](sex-and-gender.html) and the [Gender Harmony Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/xprod/ig/uv/gender-harmony/).
- See guidance on the construction of identifiers in each Identifier profile and the section on [Business Identifiers](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/generalguidance.html#business-identifiers) in AU Base.
- Refer to the [AU eRequesting Workflow Guidance](workflow.html) page for guidance on managing workflow states in AU eRequesting.
- See the [Diagnostic Request Grouping](general-guidance.html#diagnostic-request-grouping) section for guidance on grouping diagnostic requests in AU eRequesting.
- The provision of an insurance attribute describes a recommendation to be considered by the filler and does not guarantee that this recommendation will be satisfied.
- `ServiceRequest.encounter` and `ServiceRequest.encounter.reference` are mandatory to support `Encounter.class`, which classifies the patient encounter and is required by the filler for billing purposes.
- `ServiceRequest.occurenceTiming.repeat.count` can be used to specify the number of diagnostic requests to be performed.
- Resources referenced by `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo` can be referenced by all ServiceRequests in a group when the information applies across the group, or by individual ServiceRequests when the information is specific to particular requests.
  - Use `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo:pregnancyStatus` to record pregnancy, with the permitted value of Pregnant, only when it applies to the request.
  - Use `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo:clinicalContext` to supply text narrative that provides the broader clinical background or circumstances related to the request.
- Use `ServiceRequest.note` to record general comments or administrative notes about the request.
  - Information recorded in `ServiceRequest.note` **SHALL NOT** duplicate or overlap with clinical context captured in `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo:clinicalContext`, or with any other information recorded in the ServiceRequest.
