### Profile specific implementation guidance
- This abstract profile provides a shared base that is common across requests for specific domains. It is not intended for direct implementation. Where a profile is defined for a specific domain that profile **SHALL** be used:
  - pathology requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Pathology Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-path.html) profile
  - imaging requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Imaging Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-imag.html) profile 
- The provision of an insurance attribute describes a recommendation to be considered by the Filler and does not guarantee that this recommendation will be satisfied.
- See the [AU eRequesting Workflow Guidance](workflow.html) page for guidance on managing workflow states in AU eRequesting.
- Resources referenced by `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo` can be referenced by all ServiceRequests in a group when the information applies across the group, or by individual ServiceRequests when the information is specific to particular requests. `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo` is used to represent the following additional clinical information accompanying the request:
  - Pregnancy Status:
    - Represented using `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo:pregnancyStatus` referencing an [Observation Pregnancy - Status (IPS)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/StructureDefinition-Observation-pregnancy-status-uv-ips.html).
    - Only the pregnancy status of 77386006 \|Pregnant\| is permitted.
  - Clinical context:
    -  Provides a narrative overview of the patient's current clinical situation and is represented using `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo:clinicalContext` referencing an [AU eRequesting Clinical Context DocumentReference](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-clinicalcontext-documentreference.html).
    - The [AU eRequesting Clinical Context DocumentReference](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-clinicalcontext-documentreference.html) **SHALL** be implemented as a plain text string (`text/plain`) embedded inline using `DocumentReference.content.attachment.data` (base64-encoded).
    - Although `ServiceRequest.note` can be used for clinical notes, it is limited to notes bound to a single ServiceRequest. `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo:clinicalContext` allows the same clinical context to be referenced across multiple related ServiceRequests. 
      - To support clear presentation by fillers and avoid duplication, clinical notes common across multiple ServiceRequests in a group **SHOULD** be captured using a single referenced [AU eRequesting Clinical Context DocumentReference](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-clinicalcontext-documentreference.html), rather than repeated in each instance of `ServiceRequest.note`. 
      - It is recommended that information contained in `ServiceRequest.supportingInfo` and `ServiceRequest.note` is distinct and not duplicated.
