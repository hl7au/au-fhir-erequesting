### Profile specific implementation guidance
- This abstract profile provides a shared base that is common across requests for specific domains. It is not intended for direct implementation. Where a profile is defined for a specific domain that profile **SHALL** be used:
  - pathology requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Pathology Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-path.html) profile
  - imaging requests **SHALL** use [AU eRequesting Imaging Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-servicerequest-imag.html) profile 
- The provision of an insurance attribute describes a recommendation to be considered by the Filler and does not guarantee that this recommendation will be satisfied.
- See the [AU eRequesting Workflow State Guidance](workflow-state.html) page for guidance on managing workflow states in AU eRequesting, where the [AU eRequesting Task Diagnostic Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-task-diagnosticrequest.html) tracks the fulfilment of the [AU eRequesting Diagnostic Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-diagnosticrequest.html). It covers the use of supporting elements such as `ServiceRequest.extension:statusReason` to provide additional workflow context, and the relationship between Task and ServiceRequest statuses. This guidance is intended to promote interoperability within AU eRequesting.
