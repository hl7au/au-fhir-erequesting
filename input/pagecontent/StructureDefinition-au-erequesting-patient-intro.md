Obligations for AU Core actors ([AU Core Requester](https://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/2.0.0/ActorDefinition-au-core-actor-requester.html) and [AU Core Responder](https://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/2.0.0/ActorDefinition-au-core-actor-responder.html)) inherited from [AU Core Patient](https://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/2.0.0/StructureDefinition-au-core-patient.html) currently render in the profile view. This is a tooling limitation, and only the AU eRequesting actor obligations should be applied.
