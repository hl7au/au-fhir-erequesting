Obligations for AU Core actors ([AU Core Requester](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/ActorDefinition-au-core-actor-requester.html) and [AU Core Responder](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/ActorDefinition-au-core-actor-responder.html)) inherited from [AU Core Patient](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/StructureDefinition-au-core-patient.html) currently render in the profile view. This is a tooling limitation, and only the AU eRequesting actor obligations should be applied. See [Zulip discussion](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/215610-shorthand/topic/Sushi.20merging.20profile.20extension.20with.20parent.20content/with/545567478) for more information.
