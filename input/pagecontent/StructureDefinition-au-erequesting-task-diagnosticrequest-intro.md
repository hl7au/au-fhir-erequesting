### Profile specific implementation guidance
- See the [AU eRequesting Workflow State Guidance](workflow.html) page for guidance on managing workflow states in AU eRequesting, where the [AU eRequesting Task Diagnostic Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-task-diagnosticrequest.html) tracks the fulfilment of the [AU eRequesting Diagnostic Request](StructureDefinition-au-erequesting-diagnosticrequest.html). It covers Task state transitions, the use of supporting elements such as `Task.statusReason` and `Task.businessStatus` to provide additional workflow context, and the relationship between Task and ServiceRequest statuses. This guidance is intended to promote interoperability within AU eRequesting.
