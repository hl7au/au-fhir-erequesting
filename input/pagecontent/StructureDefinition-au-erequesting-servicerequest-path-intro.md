<div class="stu-note">It is intended that this profile will always support the latest version of the SPIA Requesting Pathology Terminology Reference Set available. At this time the latest version of the SPIA Requesting Pathology Terminology Reference Set is v4.2. Implementers are advised to take note that the current binding <a href="https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/ValueSet/spia-requesting-refset-3">RCPA - SPIA Requesting Pathology Terminology Reference Set</a> currently supports v3.1 and will be replaced with a version that support v4.2 as soon as it is available in the National Clinical Terminology Service.</div>

### Profile specific implementation guidance
- `ServiceRequest.code`:
  - **SHOULD** be selected from the preferred <a href="https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/ValueSet/spia-requesting-refset-3">RCPA - SPIA Requesting Pathology Terminology Reference Set</a> value set
  - if a system is unable to provide a code from the preferred <a href="https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/ValueSet/spia-requesting-refset-3">RCPA - SPIA Requesting Pathology Terminology Reference Set</a>, it is preferred to select a suitable code from the SNOMED CT <a href="https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/pathology-procedure-1">Pathology Procedure</a> value set over only supplying local codes
  - coding is preferred over supplying only free text with no codes
- The use of coding can vary significantly across systems, implementers need to understand that they may encounter codes they do not recognise and be prepared to handle those resources appropriately. Systems **SHALL** populate `ServiceRequest.code.text` so that systems can at least display the service requested even if the system does not recognise the code supplied.
