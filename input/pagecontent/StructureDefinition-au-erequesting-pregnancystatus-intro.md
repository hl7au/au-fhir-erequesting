### Usage Scenarios
The following are example usage scenarios for this profile:
* Query for a patient's pregnancy status
* Record a past or present pregnancy status

### Profile Specific Implementation Guidance
* The AU eRequesting Pregnancy Status profile allows a pregnancy status of 'pregnant' only, as advised by AUCDI authors to ensure future compatibility. A future AUCDI pregnancy summary concept is expected to describe pregnancy status within a single pregnancy and potentially include more granular states to encompass a continuum of pregnancy states. This will guide future changes to the AU eRequesting Pregnancy Status profile, and potential additional statuses.
