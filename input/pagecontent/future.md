### Future of AU eRequesting
Planning and scoping for AU eRequesting Release 2 will occur in 2026 through HL7 AU community processes. Scope candidates will be considered based on input from the community, including new proposals and items deferred from Release 1.

The following AUeReqDI Release 1 data groups were deferred and may inform future AU eRequesting scope:
* Adverse reaction risk summary
* Implanted medical device summary
* Problem/Diagnosis summary

Issues deferred during the AU eRequesting Release 1 ballot cycles are tracked in Jira ([Link to Deferred List in Jira](https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20FHIR%20AND%20Specification%20%3D%20%22%5BFHIR-au-erequesting%5D%22%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Deferred)).
