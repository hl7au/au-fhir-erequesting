# === ERROR 01 (NEW + ACCEPTED BY FHIR WG/AU CORE TDG + TO BE ACCEPTED BY EREQ TDG): This issue will be fixed in a later version of the IG Publisher (see: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Publisher.20v2.2E0.2E24.20-.20error.20in.20local.20build). ===

# === WARNING 01 (ACCEPTED BY FHIR WG, PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED BY EREQ TDG): These are warnings for publication artefacts not used in HL7 AU specifications at this time and are accepted by the AU FHIR WG. ===

# === WARNING 02: INHERITED FROM AU BASE (PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED BY EREQ TDG): Artefacts inherit multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier). The IG Publisher cannot match example instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU Base. ===

# === INFORMATION 01: INHERITED FROM FHIR STANDARD (PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED BY EREQ TDG): Some FHIR standard ValueSets are deprecated. ===
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# === INFORMATION 02: (2 NEW INFO + ACCEPTED BY FHIR WG/AU CORE TDG + TO BE ACCEPTED BY EREQ TDG): These issues are known FHIR standard and Extension Pack future version and current deprecations. ===
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note: 'This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex'
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# === INFORMATION 03: INHERITED FROM IPS (NEW + TO BE ACCEPTED BY EREQ TDG): This is IPS managed content.===

# === INFORMATION 04: (PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED BY EREQ TDG): Information about the use of standard CapabilityStatementExpectation extension in additional contexts to fully express intended capabilities; see FHIR-12419. ===
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/capabilitystatement-search-parameter-combination|5.2.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# === INFORMATION 05: (NEW + ACCEPTED BY AU CORE TDG + TO BE ACCEPTED BY EREQ TDG): The use of the obligation extension generates multiple slicing information messages in the snapshot. This extension is reused across many resources in leading to repeated validation messages that do not appear to indicate an actual problem. Other IGs that are using obligations (e.g. IPS, IPA, EPS) show the same set of QA "element does not match any known slice" slicing information messages that have been accepted for publication (see https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Obligations.20extension.20does.20not.20meet.20slice/with/553529895). ===
