An HTML fragment from the set [cross-version-analysis.xhtml, cross-version-analysis-inline.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
The HTML fragment 'globals-table.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide

# === WARNING: This occurs because the resource is actively used while the overall IG is still in draft status. ===
The resource status 'active' and the standards status 'draft' are not consistent

# === WARNING: IPS version 2.0.0-ballot is intentionally referenced. This warning can be ignored, the reference will be updated to 2.0.0 when it is published. ===
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.uv.ips#2.0.0-ballot released on 2024-08-12, but the most recent appropriate version is 1.1.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# === WARNING: These warnings are present as the IG Publisher is unable to resolve National Clinical Terminology Service (NCTS) profiles. At this time no npm package for the NCTS IG is available and there is no timeline for resolution. These warnings were accepted by the FHIR WG. ===
A definition could not be found for Canonical URL 'https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/StructureDefinition/composed-value-set-4'
Profile reference 'https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/StructureDefinition/composed-value-set-4' has not been checked because it could not be found, and the validator is set to not fetch unknown profiles

# === WARNING: Artefacts inherit multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier) from AU Base. The IG Publisher cannot match example instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU Core and AU Base. These warnings were accepted in AU Core v1.0.0. ===
