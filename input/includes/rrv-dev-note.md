Work is underway within [RANZCR](https://www.ranzcr.com/) to finalise the development of the Radiology Referral Set (RRS) with the aim of including all radiology procedures performed in Australia. The RANZCR Radiology Referral Value Set (RRV) included in the AU eRequesting IG is an evolving draft that is derived from the latest agreed set of concepts from the RRS. At this time the value set contains the concepts for X-Ray, Angiography and Ultrasound. Implementers are advised to take note that concepts within the value set will continue to expand and evolve when further iterations of the Radiology Referral Set are available. 
When the work on the RRV is completed the value set will be published in [NCTS](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir).
