Work is underway within [RANZCR](https://www.ranzcr.com/) to finalise the development of the Radiology Referral Set - RRS - with the aim of including all radiology procedures performed in Australia. The Radiology Referral Value Set - RRV - included in the AU eRequesting IG is an evolving draft that is derived from the latest agreed set of concepts from the RRS. RANZCR and [NCTS](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir) are also working to resolve gaps in the representation of radiology procedures within SNOMED CT as single codes for inclusion in the RRV. As a result of this ongoing work, the value set will continue to expand and evolve when further iterations of the RRS and new SNOMED CT concepts are available.
