#### AU eRequesting 1.0.0-preview for Testing 

This December 2025 preview snapshot incorporates the normative changes from AU eRequesting 1.0.0-ballot. This snapshot supports testing of AU eRequesting 1.0.0 prior to publication.

Key updates and changes in this version are shown in the AU eRequesting [Change Log](changes.html).

Testing plays a crucial role in the development of AU eRequesting. It helps to build an AU eRequesting that is aligned with its intended purpose and is practical, and responsive to the diverse needs of various stakeholders.

Testing AU eRequesting helps identify issues, challenges, or gaps in the specification, enabling its improvement. During testing, implementers test their FHIR resources, software products, and/or proof of concepts with AU eRequesting and provide essential feedback.
