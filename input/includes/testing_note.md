#### AU eRequesting 0.4.0-preview for testing 

This June 2025 preview snapshot supports testing of AU eRequesting prior to Ballot of AU eRequesting R1.

Testing plays a crucial role in the development of AU eRequesting. It helps to build an AU eRequesting that is aligned with its intended purpose and is practical, and responsive to the diverse needs of various stakeholders.  

Testing AU eRequesting helps identify issues, challenges, or gaps in the specification, enabling its improvement. During testing, implementers test their FHIR resources, software products, and/or proof of concepts with AU eRequesting and provide essential feedback.
